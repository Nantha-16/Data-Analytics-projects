📊 Sales Data Analysis – EDA Project

📝 Project Overview
- This project involves an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of sales data to derive actionable business insights. The analysis covers data cleaning, creation of key sales metrics, customer churn analysis, and RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) segmentation. The goal is to understand customer behavior, identify churn patterns, and support data-driven business strategies.

🔧 Technologies Used
- Python

- Pandas, NumPy – Data manipulation and analysis

- Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization

- Jupyter Notebook – Interactive development

- Scikit-learn (optional) – For clustering or modeling (e.g., in RFM segmentation)

🔍 Key Analysis Components
🧹 Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values, duplicates, and incorrect data types

- Standardized date formats and created derived columns for further analysis

📈 Sales Metrics
- Monthly/weekly revenue trends

- Top-performing products and regions

- Average order value, number of orders per customer, etc.

🔁 Churn Analysis
- Defined churn based on customer inactivity thresholds

- Identified churned vs. active customers

- Visualized churn rate over time

🎯 RFM Analysis
- Calculated Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values for each customer

- Segmented customers into RFM groups

- Identified high-value, at-risk, and lost customer segments

📌 Insights & Outcomes
- Discovered seasonal sales trends and peak performance periods

- Identified a segment of high-value customers for retention campaigns

- Flagged customers at high risk of churn

- Recommended strategies for targeting different RFM segments
